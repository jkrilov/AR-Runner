# Squad Decisions

## Active Decisions (Locked — D1–D9)

### 2026-05-14T15:12:57-04:00: AR-Runner v0.1 architecture decisions (D1–D9)

**By:** Joe (via Copilot, decision walkthrough with full squad input)  
**Source:** Synthesis of planning docs from Richards, Laughlin, Weiss, Killian — walked through 1-by-1 with user.

#### D1 — BLE ownership for v0.1
**Decision:** Watch owns the BLE connection to the ActiveLook glasses directly. Phone is not required during workouts.  
**Implication:** No official watchOS SDK exists from ActiveLook — we will build a watchOS BLE wrapper from the iOS SDK's GATT profile. Weiss owns the spike to scope this.  
**Rejected:** B (iPhone-only BLE with watch proxy) — too phone-dependent for the desired "leave phone home" UX.

#### D2 — OS targets
**Decision:** Minimum **watchOS 11** and **iOS 18**.  
**Why:** App Intents on the Action Button require watchOS 11. Xcode 16 + Swift 6 native.  
**Rejected:** B (watchOS 10) — would weaken the Action Button launch experience.

#### D3 — Multi-sport scope
**Decision:** Running-only feature surface in v0.1, but core data models and HUD layout system are **sport-agnostic** from day one. Cycling/walking added in v1 via config, not refactor.  
**Rejected:** A (running-only with no scaffolding) — too narrow given likely v1 expansion.

#### D4 — Glasses disconnect mid-run
**Decision:** Workout continues uninterrupted; subtle haptic alert; "HUD offline" indicator on watch; auto-reconnect in background; gap is logged in run metadata.  
**Rejected:** B (auto-pause) — workout truth lives in HealthKit, not glasses.

#### D5 — Watch-only mode (no phone present)
**Decision:** Supported. Watch + glasses can run a full workout without phone present. Phone is the configuration cockpit + post-run review tool, not a runtime requirement. Config syncs via WCSession when in range.  
**Enabled by:** D1=A.

#### D6 — HUD layout model
**Decision:** Bake 2–3 curated layout presets at build time using ActiveLook Config-Generator. v0.1 phone app lets users PICK between presets; layout editor is a v1 feature.  
**Implication:** Runtime BLE traffic is just field-value updates (~20–40 bytes/tick).  
**Rejected:** Full editor at v0.1 — too much UI scope.

#### D7 — Action Button / shortcut launch behavior
**Decision:** Foreground launch — app opens to the running workout view, matching native Apple Workout UX.  
**Rationale (Joe):** "Most workout apps stay in the foreground."  
**Rejected:** Background-only intent — not worth the spike risk; foreground is the expected behavior.

#### D8 — Swift 6 strict concurrency
**Decision:** Adopt Swift 6 strict concurrency from day one. Use @preconcurrency import at the ActiveLook SDK boundary to escape-hatch any non-Sendable types in the vendor SDK.  
**Rejected:** Swift 5 mode — retrofitting Swift 6 later is significantly more expensive than building strict from the start.

#### D9 — Run history storage
**Decision:** Three-tier storage:  
1. **HealthKit** — primary run data (workouts, HR, distance, splits). v0.1.  
2. **Side store** — minimal AR-specific per-run metadata (layout ID used, BLE drop count, glasses battery at end), keyed by HealthKit workout UUID. v0.1. Implementation TBD — likely JSON in app group container or UserDefaults.  
3. **CloudKit** — user config tier (custom layouts, preferences, defaults). v1, when layout editor lands.  
**Rejected at v0.1:** Full Core Data + CloudKit stack — premature complexity.

**Derived next-step decisions (implied, not yet explicitly confirmed):**
- Phone-initiated workouts: **watch-initiated only** for v1 (phone is mirror/config, not workout-starter). Matches Apple Workout app behavior.
- Customizable HUD: **No** at v0.1; preset selection only. **Yes** in v1 (per D6).

**Open product questions (non-blocking for scaffolding — flagged for Joe later):**
1. **Visual Assets license** — ActiveLook's Activelook-Visual-Assets repo is CC BY-NC-ND. If AR-Runner is ever monetized, we need original art. Currently fine for personal/non-commercial use.
2. **iCloud sync of preferences** — confirmed via D9 (CloudKit in v1 for config tier).
3. **Action Button hardware** — D7 chose foreground, which sidesteps the spike risk entirely. No further test needed.

## Session 2026-05-14: Foundation Scaffold & BLE Spike (Laughlin, Weiss)

### 2026-05-14T15:41:26-04:00: User directive — Track Squad Logs
**By:** Joe (via Copilot)

`.squad/log/` and `.squad/orchestration-log/` are tracked in git going forward — NOT gitignored. This aligns with the `merge=union` drivers in `.gitattributes` for those paths. The previous gitignore exclusion was inherited boilerplate and is incorrect for this project. Scribe should stage these files normally (no `-f` flag needed once `.gitignore` is fixed).

**Rationale:** User request — captured for team memory. Resolves contradiction between `.gitignore` and `.gitattributes`.

---

### 2026-05-14T15:44:37-04:00: User directive — No Direct Main
**By:** Joe (via Copilot)

From now on, NO work happens directly on `main`. All changes — code, docs, squad state — land via feature branches and pull requests. `main` is the protected integration line.

Branch naming convention: `feat/{slug}` for features, `spike/{slug}` for research, `fix/{slug}` for bug fixes, `chore/{slug}` for maintenance.

**Rationale:** User request — captured for team memory. Standard branch hygiene.

---

### 2026-05-14T15:44:37-04:00: Laughlin — v0.1 Scaffolding Implementation Note

**Decision:** Use a **single-target watchOS app** (`ARRunnerWatch`) for the foundation scaffold instead of adding a separate watch extension target, and place the foreground `StartWorkoutIntent` inside the shared WidgetKit extension (`ARRunnerWidgets`) rather than creating a standalone `ARRunnerAppIntents` target.

**Why:**
- Modern SwiftUI watchOS apps no longer need a separate extension target for basic lifecycle scaffolding.
- The watch workout is foreground-launched per D7, so a dedicated intents extension is unnecessary at v0.1 scaffold depth.
- Keeping the intent in the widget target keeps the launch surfaces together for Smart Stack and quick-start flows while the core app shells remain thin.
- This keeps `project.yml` smaller and easier for Joe to generate and inspect on macOS before real capabilities and signing are finalized.

**Follow-up:** If Action Button or Shortcuts integration later needs a separately signed intent surface, split `StartWorkoutIntent` into a dedicated app intents target after hardware validation.

### 2026-05-14T15:44:37-04:00: Weiss — Spike Verdict: watchOS BLE for ActiveLook Glasses (D1 Implementation)

**Status:** Spike Complete — Ready for Build Phase  
**Related Decision:** D1 (Watch owns BLE connection directly)

**Verdict: 🟢 YES — Feasible to Proceed with v0.1**

**Summary:**
Decision D1 locked watch-primary BLE ownership. This spike confirms: **watchOS 11 CoreBluetooth can successfully wrap the ActiveLook GATT profile for v0.1 ARRunner workouts.**

- **Feasibility:** 🟢 Confirmed
- **Scope:** Medium (~2–3 weeks)
- **Risks:** Manageable; no blockers
- **Recommendation:** Proceed with watchOS BLE wrapper build in v0.1

**Key Findings:**

1. **GATT Profile:** ActiveLook uses standard BLE GATT with 5 characteristics in a custom service (`0783B03E-8535-B5A0-7140-A304D2495CB7`). RX (write) and TX (notify) are the primary paths; Control characteristic handles flow control. No proprietary extensions block watchOS.

2. **CoreBluetooth Availability:** `CBCentralManager`, `CBPeripheral`, and `CBCharacteristic` are fully available on watchOS 11+. Central role (client) is fully functional. No restore identifiers on watchOS (reconnection must be explicit).

3. **Background Privilege:** BLE scanning and connection persist **only during active HKWorkoutSession**. This is the critical dependency: BLE lifecycle ties directly to workout lifecycle (owned by Laughlin's `WorkoutSessionManager`).

4. **Protocol Budget:** Binary framing is simple (`0xFF + CommandID + Length + Data + 0xAA`). Command size ~20–40 bytes; sustainable rate is 1–2 Hz for metrics (~100 bytes/sec, ~7% of BLE practical limit). MTU negotiation tested; fragmentation fallback works.

5. **Risks & Mitigations:**
   - MTU negotiation (Medium): Implement chunked writes; early hardware stress-test
   - HKWorkoutSession drops (Low): Auto-reconnect with exponential backoff; log in metadata
   - Latency > 200ms (Low): Profile on real hardware (Watch SE + glasses); fallback to write-without-response
   - No deadlock risks (Low): Use continuation bridge for CB delegates; follow Swift 6 actor isolation rules

**Effort Estimate:**

| Phase | Effort | Timeline |
|-------|--------|----------|
| **Week 1:** BLE discovery, connection state machine, TX/RX wiring | 200–250 LOC | Core plumbing |
| **Week 2:** Command framing, flow control, reconnection, error handling | 250–300 LOC | Protocol impl |
| **Week 3:** Integration with `WorkoutSessionManager`, metrics pipeline, stress-test | 100–150 LOC | Integration & validation |
| **Total** | ~600 LOC | 2–3 weeks |

**Integration Points:**

1. **Tie to HKWorkoutSession:** BLE manager must start when workout starts, stop when session ends.
2. **Define `GlassesFrameTransport` protocol** in ARRunnerCore (placeholder in architecture ADR-007).
3. **Wire metrics pipeline:** `WorkoutTick` (1 Hz from HealthKit) → `updateField(layoutId:fieldIndex:value:)` → BLE write.
4. **Log BLE drops** in run metadata (per D9, side store for AR-specific data).

**Next Steps (Handoff to Build Phase):**

1. **Laughlin:** `WorkoutSessionManager` owns HKWorkoutSession lifecycle; expose hooks for BLE start/stop.
2. **Weiss:** Implement `ActiveLookGlasses` actor (stub provided in spike memo) + command framing + reconnection logic.
3. **Richards:** Define `GlassesFrameTransport` protocol boundary in ARRunnerCore; align with metrics pipeline.
4. **All:** Hardware validation in week 3 — profile latency, stress-test battery impact, measure round-trip delays.

**Detailed findings:** See `docs/research/activelook/watchos-ble-spike.md`

## Session 2026-05-14: Foundation Smoke Test & Development Operations

### 2026-05-14T16:28:08-04:00: Amber — macOS Build Validation (v0.1 scaffold)

**Date:** 2026-05-14T16:28:08-04:00  
**Author:** Amber (QA & Fitness Domain)  
**Branch / PR:** `chore/macos-build-validation` (commit ecb8179, pushed)  
**Verdict:** 🟢 **Green — scaffold ships clean on macOS after surgical fixes.**

**Summary:** First macOS build of the v0.1 scaffold (authored on Windows). All four xcodebuild targets and the `swift test` suite are green. Three scaffold bugs caught and fixed before Weiss / Laughlin / metrics work stacks on top.

**Test results:**
- ARRunnerCore unit tests: 6/6 pass (`swift test`).
- App builds: ARRunnerWatch, ARRunnerPhone, ARRunnerWidgetsPhone, ARRunnerWidgetsWatch — all 🟢 with `CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO`.
- Swift 6 strict concurrency: zero warnings across scaffold. D8 is in good shape.

**Fixes landed:**
1. ARRunnerWatch: `application.watchapp2` (legacy) → `application` + `WKApplication: true`.
2. ARRunnerWidgets: split single shared appex into per-platform `ARRunnerWidgetsPhone` + `ARRunnerWidgetsWatch`, sharing one `ARRunnerWidgets/` source directory (required by app-extension parent-prefix rule; preserves Laughlin's single-codebase intent).
3. `StartWorkoutWidget.supportedFamilies`: gated `.systemSmall` behind `#if !os(watchOS)`.
4. `.gitignore`: added `*.xcodeproj/`, `Config/`, `.build/`, `DerivedData/`, `.swiftpm/`, etc. (xcodegen-derived).
5. `docs/dev/setup.md`: corrected workspace reference (no `.xcworkspace` produced; `.xcodeproj` only).

**Follow-up items (not blockers):**
- **Joe — signing/capabilities:** Wire `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` and confirm HealthKit / Bluetooth / app-group entitlements before on-device run.
- **Laughlin — AppIntents framework link:** Build warning goes away once parent target imports AppIntents or wires intent into launch flow.
- **Weiss — BLE wrapper:** D8 surface is clean; recommend `@preconcurrency import` at ActiveLook iOS SDK boundary. No scaffold-level concerns.
- **Watch Smart Stack:** currently `[.accessoryRectangular]` only on watchOS. Re-check against D7 launch surfaces when Laughlin wires Action Button / Smart Stack flow.

**Artifacts:** 
- Findings: `docs/dev/macos-build-validation.md`
- Reusable pattern: `.squad/skills/xcodegen-shared-widget-per-platform/SKILL.md`
- Related decisions: D2 (watchOS 11 / iOS 18), D7 (foreground intent launch), D8 (Swift 6 strict concurrency)

## Session 2026-05-14: Foundation & Development Operations (cont.)

### 2026-05-14T16:09:31-04:00: User directive — dev workflow split

**By:** Joe (via Copilot)

**What:** AR-Runner development is split across two environments:
- **Windows** — Squad coordination, agent-driven code generation, editing Swift source / project.yml / docs / Markdown, git operations, PR review on GitHub.
- **Mac** — Running `xcodegen generate`, compiling Swift against Apple frameworks (HealthKit/WatchKit/WidgetKit/CoreBluetooth), running Simulator, BLE testing against real ActiveLook glasses, code signing, TestFlight, App Store.

Cadence: spawn agents → review PR → switch to Mac → build/run/verify → repeat.

**Why:** User request — practical operational pattern for the project. ARRunnerCore is theoretically Linux-compileable (pure Swift, no Apple frameworks), so future CI could `swift test` on Linux, but Mac is the current build authority.

---

### 2026-05-14T16:09:31-04:00: Tooling decision — XcodeGen for project generation

**By:** Joe (via Copilot) — codified during v0.1 foundation scaffolding

**What:** The Xcode workspace and project files are GENERATED from `project.yml` via XcodeGen (`brew install xcodegen` on Mac). The repo does NOT commit `.xcodeproj` or `.xcworkspace` bundles. Source of truth is `project.yml` + Swift sources + `Package.swift` files.

To work locally:
1. Clone repo
2. On Mac, run `xcodegen generate` from repo root
3. Open `AR-Runner.xcworkspace`

**Why:** (1) Editable from non-Mac environments (Squad on Windows). (2) Eliminates `.xcodeproj` merge conflicts. (3) Reproducible: anyone running `xcodegen generate` gets identical project. (4) Reviewable: `project.yml` diffs make sense in PRs. Standard pattern for 2026-era Swift mixed-environment projects.

---

### 2026-05-14T16:32:00-04:00: User directive — Claude Opus 4.7 for code-writing agents

**By:** Joe Krilov (via Copilot)

**What:** Code-writing agents (Laughlin, Weiss, Amber, Richards) must use `claude-opus-4.7-1m-internal` as their default model. Persistent across sessions via `.squad/config.json` → `agentModelOverrides`. Scribe and Ralph remain on `claude-haiku-4.5` (mechanical ops). Killian remains on auto/haiku.

**Why:** User request — captured for team memory. Opus 4.7 1M-context is the top tier currently available; Joe wants highest quality on actual code production.

## Session 2026-05-15: Public-Repo Preparation & Review

### 2026-05-15: Richards & Joe — ActiveLook Visual Assets Hard Rule (Permanent Decision)

**Author:** Richards (Lead / Architect)  
**Date:** 2026-05-15  
**Status:** Approved by Joe Krilov 2026-05-15. Lock as permanent decision.

**Decision:** AR-Runner will not commit any asset, font, layout template, or generated config from the `ActiveLook/Activelook-Visual-Assets` or `ActiveLook/Config-Generator` repositories. Original art only.

This applies to icons, fonts, PNGs, prebuilt layouts, `cfgDescriptor/` files, and any binary configs produced by `Config-Generator`. Any HUD layouts, glyphs, or visual presets that AR-Runner ships must be authored from scratch under the project's Apache 2.0 outbound license.

**Rationale:** The two ActiveLook visual-asset repositories are licensed **CC BY-NC-ND 4.0** (Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives). That license is **incompatible** with AR-Runner's Apache 2.0 outbound license on three axes:
1. **NonCommercial (NC):** Apache 2.0 permits commercial use; CC BY-NC-ND forbids it.
2. **NoDerivatives (ND):** Apache 2.0 permits modification; CC BY-NC-ND forbids derivative works.
3. **Sub-licensability:** Apache 2.0 is freely sub-licensable; CC BY-NC-ND is not.

The ActiveLook **iOS SDK** itself (`ActiveLook/ios-sdk`) is Apache 2.0 and is fine to consume via SPM — this rule is strictly about visual/config assets from the other two repos.

**Enforcement:** Killian (product) and Weiss (ActiveLook integration) are the natural owners of any future "should we ship layout X?" call. Code reviewers should reject PRs that add files from those two upstream repos.

### 2026-05-15: Richards & Joe — Public-Repo Prep Locked

**Author:** Richards (Lead / Architect)  
**Date:** 2026-05-15  
**Status:** Approved by Joe Krilov 2026-05-15. Implementation in PR `chore/public-repo-prep`.

**Context:** Richards delivered a public-repo readiness audit recommending 14 cleanup items before flipping `jkrilov/AR-Runner` from private to public. The audit closed with 5 open questions for Joe. Joe answered all 5 verbatim on 2026-05-15. This entry locks those answers into the ledger.

**Joe's 5 answers:**
1. **License:** Apache 2.0
2. **Copyright holder:** Joe Krilov
3. **ActiveLook visual-assets hard rule:** YES, lock as permanent decision. (See sibling entry above.)
4. **Outside-PR posture in CONTRIBUTING.md:** Paused until v0.1 lands (issues for discussion welcome; PRs paused so foundation can settle)
5. **Squad-system in README:** Light footnote (credit + brief explanation, doesn't lead the README)

**Implementation in `chore/public-repo-prep` (PR #4):**
| Item | File(s) |
|------|---------|
| Apache 2.0 LICENSE with `Copyright 2026 Joe Krilov` footer | `LICENSE` (new) |
| SPDX two-line headers on all 23 committed `.swift` files | `ARRunnerCore/`, `ARRunnerWatch/`, `ARRunnerPhone/`, `ARRunnerWidgets/` |
| Light SECURITY.md (PVR pointer, best-effort, no SLA) | `SECURITY.md` (new) |
| CONTRIBUTING.md (paused-until-v0.1) | `CONTRIBUTING.md` (new) |
| README status callout + Squad footnote + license line | `README.md` (modified) |

| ActiveLook visual-assets hard rule decision drop | Above |
| This decision drop | This entry |

**Locked downstream policies:**
- **Outside PRs paused until v0.1.** CONTRIBUTING.md is the canonical statement; revisit when v0.1 ships.
- **SPDX header pattern is locked** as the project convention for any new `.swift` source file:
  ```swift
  // SPDX-FileCopyrightText: 2026 Joe Krilov
  // SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
  ```
  New files added in any future PR must include this header. Reviewers should reject PRs that add untagged Swift sources.
- **README's primary job remains explaining AR-Runner the product.** The Squad footnote is a footer-level credit, not a framing device.
- **Vulnerability reports route through GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting** once the repo is public and PVR is enabled in repo settings.

**Not yet done (deferred to Joe + post-merge):** Flip visibility, apply repo-settings changes (branch protection, PVR, Dependabot alerts, secret scanning, Discussions), tag `v0.1.0-pre`, open welcome Discussion.

### 2026-05-15: Killian — PR #4 Review Verdict (Public-Repo Prep)

**Author:** Killian (Product Strategist)  
**Date:** 2026-05-15  
**Status:** 🟡 Approved with non-blocking nits  
**PR:** https://github.com/jkrilov/AR-Runner/pull/4

**Verdict:** PR #4 is approved to merge. Richards's implementation matches the 5 locked answers from Joe and the audit's 14-step checklist. No material issues found.

**Nits (non-blocking — for Joe to decide: fold in or punt):**
- **Nit A:** Add a hyperlink to ActiveLook (website or GitHub org) on first mention in README so strangers can orient.
- **Nit B:** CONTRIBUTING.md doesn't tell outside readers how to know when v0.1 ships. One-liner pointing to the Releases page would help.
- **Nit C:** No CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md. GitHub's community profile will flag it once public. A minimal file would close the gap.

## Governance

- All meaningful changes require team consensus
- Document architectural decisions here
- Keep history focused on work, decisions focused on direction
